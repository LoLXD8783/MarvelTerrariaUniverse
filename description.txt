MTU brings a new superhero experience to Terraria. Inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this mod focuses on adding content from the MCU such as Items, NPCs, Bosses, etc. Currently you can play as Iron Man with his unique weapons and flight. You can also check out the WIP items using Cheat Sheet. This is only the beginning...

IMPORTNANT NOTE: This build is a very rough, unfinished preview of what the mod has to offer in the future. You will need to use Cheat Sheet to obtain most of the items as we are yet to decide the crafting recipes and obtainability.

- Iron Man Repulsor & Unibeam weapons (Left & Right click respectively)
- Iron Man flight ('F' button)
